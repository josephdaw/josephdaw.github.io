## Description
This is a responsive website designed using a "mobile first" philosophy to showcase my programming projects.

As I learn new technologies and improve my coding skills I plan to update this page accordingly. I will leave the previous comments with links to the various iterations as an homage to the development journey.

You can [view the current version](https://josephdaw.github.io/) on Github Pages at https://josephdaw.github.io/.

## Iteration #3
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-%61DAFB.svg?&logo=react&logoColor=white)

This version is using React and React Router to make this website. This is my first experience playing around with React. I am enjoying the ability to create components and re-use them; for example the NavBar. I still have a long way to go until I feel completely comfortable using React.

## Iteration #2
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)
![MaterializeCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/materialize-ee6e73.svg)

With this version I wanted to experiment with a framework that I hadn't used before. I ended up settling on [MaterializeCSS](https://materializecss.com/). I have found it to be a pretty user-friendly framework. The documentation has been easy enough to follow. The main hurdle is probably sorting out the colour scheme.

## Iteration #1
![HTML5](https://img.shields.io/badge/html5-%23E34F26.svg?&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

As the focus of this site has been responsive design, I have used CSS flex-box extensively to acheive this objective. This project has been a good, and sometimes painful, lesson in how to display a site responsively. This is one of the first website I have designed from the ground up, certainly the first one that is responsive.

This project has really cemented why developer tools like Chrome DevTools is such a powerful and useful resource. Up until now I have played around with it, without fully appreciating just how much it can assist with finding out how to achieve the style you are trying to achieve.
