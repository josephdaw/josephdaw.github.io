      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome, my name is Joseph Daw. I am a full stack developer with a passion for making the web a safer, more secure place.
      </p>
      <p>
        For over a decade I have been teaching myself various programming languages, rebuilding computers, and designing solutions to streamline tasks. I enjoy using technology to save time, especially for repeatitive jobs. I recently enrolled in the Adelaide University Coding Boot Camp as a way of developing my skills to a much higher level.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a project in mind I would love to hear from you. You can email me at info@josephdaw.com or reach out to me via one of the methods below.
